## Script

### [0:00-0:10] Hook

**Visual**: Your face + "Churn Intelligence System" title slide

**You**: "Hi, I'm [Your Name], a Business Analyst specializing in data-driven product decisions. Today I want to walk you through my Churn Intelligence System project."

---

### [0:10-0:30] Problem

**Visual**: Screen share → Dashboard showing KPI cards

**You**: "The challenge: A SaaS startup was losing 28% of customers within 90 days — that's 3x worse than industry average. They were acquiring users well but had a leaky bucket."

"Through data analysis, I discovered the 'silent exit' pattern: Users show warning signals 2-4 weeks before churning, but the company only found out when the cancellation email arrived. Too late."

---

### [0:30-0:60] Analysis & Insights

**Visual**: Scroll to show the onboarding funnel chart

**You**: "I analyzed 300 users across 18 months of behavioral data. The key insight: Users who reach the 'aha moment' — in this case, completing the automated workflow — have **6.5x better retention** than users who quit early."

"70% of churned users never reached onboarding Step 5. This told me exactly where to focus."

---

### [1:00-1:20] Solution

**Visual**: Click to "User Lookup" tab → Search for a user → Show risk breakdown

**You**: "I built a 5-signal churn risk model that scores users from 0-100. The dashboard automatically calculates risk tiers: Green, Amber, and Red."

[Demo the user lookup]

"Here you can see an at-risk user. The system tells us their primary risk factor is 'Low Feature Adoption' and recommends sending a Feature Discovery nudge within 48 hours."

---

### [1:20-1:40] Impact

**Visual**: Back to main dashboard → Point to KPI cards

**You**: "The results: We identified 45 at-risk users representing $2,700 in monthly revenue at risk. With targeted interventions, we project recovering $5,800 monthly — that's $69,600 annually."

"ROI is 303% with a 1.5-month payback period. The system paid for itself in 6 weeks."

---

### [1:40-1:55] Wrap Up

**Visual**: Scroll to show charts → Return to your face

**You**: "I built this end-to-end: from SQL analysis and data modeling to the interactive dashboard you see here, all using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly."

"The live dashboard is linked in the description below. Feel free to click around and explore."

---

### [1:55-2:00] Call to Action

**Visual**: Your face + contact info

**You**: "Thanks for watching. If you'd like to discuss how I can bring this approach to your team, let's connect. I'm [Your Name], and this is my Churn Intelligence System."

## Upload & Share

### LinkedIn Post (with video)

```
🎯 Just published my Churn Intelligence System project!

I analyzed 300 users to identify churn signals and built an early warning
system that recovers $69K+ in annual revenue — all without a data science team.

Key insight: Users who reach the "aha moment" have 6.5x better retention.
