### Empathy Map: Maya

#### What She SAYS
- "This is the first PM tool that actually works the way I think."
- "The Workflow Builder saved me from quitting my job during launch week."
- "I wish it had API access so I could connect it to our custom dashboard."
- "My team finally stopped asking me 'what should I work on?'"
- "Can I get a discount if I pay annually?"

#### What She THINKS (But Doesn't Say)
- *"If this tool ever shuts down, I don't know what we'd do. We're fully dependent on it now."*
- *"The analytics are good but not great — I'm eyeing [Competitor X] for better reporting."*
- *"I've built so many workflows here — switching would cost me weeks of rebuild time."*
- *"Should I suggest this to my founder? Or will they think it's too expensive?"*
- *"I hope they don't change the UI — my team finally learned it."*

#### What She DOES
- Logs in first thing every morning (7:30 AM) → checks project boards
- Spends 45% of time in Workflow Builder, 30% in Analytics, 25% in Team Huddles
- Has created 47 custom workflow automations
- Mentions TeamFlow in 3 different Slack channels daily
- Brings TeamFlow up in every team meeting: "Let's put that in the workflow"
- Submitted 2 feature requests via email (API export, custom fields)

#### What She FEELS
| Moment | Emotion | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **First successful workflow** | Empowered | "I automated my job away — finally" |
| **Team adoption friction** | Frustrated | "Why is it taking them 2 weeks to use it?" |
| **Upgrade to Team plan** | Proud | "We're growing, we need the features" |
| **Competitor launches new feature** | Nervous | "Should we switch? Too much effort" |
| **Workflow breaks** | Anxious | "Now I have to do this manually again" |

#### Pain Points
1. **No API access** — Can't build custom integrations with their internal tools
2. **Analytics depth** — Wants more advanced reporting and export options
3. **Team training** — Struggling to get 3 team members to adopt consistently
4. **Mobile app** — Feels clunky, needs better mobile experience for on-the-go updates
5. **Notification noise** — Too many emails, wants digest options

#### Gains (What She Values)
1. **Workflow automation** — Saves 3+ hours/week on manual coordination
2. **Single source of truth** — No more "where is that file?" Slack messages
3. **Team velocity visibility** — Can see who's blocked and unblock them
4. **Client Portal** — Professional delivery experience for their customers
5. **Platform reliability** — Hasn't had downtime in 6 months of daily use

### Churn Risk Assessment

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Login Frequency** | 0/25 | Daily user — no risk |
| **Onboarding** | 0/20 | Completed all steps |
| **Feature Breadth** | 0/20 | Uses 7/7 features |
| **Collaboration** | 0/20 | Heavy collaboration user |
| **Inactivity** | 0/15 | Active within 24 hours |
| **TOTAL RISK SCORE** | **0/100** | **GREEN — Healthy** |

### Retention Strategy for Maya
- **DO**: Ship the API access she requested (feature request #1)
- **DO**: Offer annual plan discount (15% off) to lock in 12-month commitment
- **DO**: Feature her in a case study — she'll become an evangelist
- **DON'T**: Send her basic onboarding nudges (she'll find them annoying)
- **DON'T**: Change the UI without warning (she's trained her team on current flow)

### Lifetime Value Projection
- **Current MRR**: $199
- **Projected Tenure**: 36 months (based on power user benchmarks)
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: $199 × 36 = **$7,164**
- **Referral Value**: Has referred 2 other PMs (potential $398 additional MRR)
- **Churn Risk**: <5% (only if competitor offers better integrations)

## Persona 2: Rohan — The Casual User

### Profile Summary
| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Name** | Rohan Verma |
| **Age** | 27 |
| **Role** | Freelance Graphic Designer |
| **Clients** | 5-7 ongoing clients, solo practitioner |
| **Tech Savviness** | Medium — comfortable with design tools, basic tech user |
| **TeamFlow Plan** | Basic ($29/month), paying monthly |
| **Status** | **AT-RISK (Amber Tier)** — Medium churn risk |

### User Journey
```
Day 0:   Signs up after Google search "simple project management for freelancers"

Day 30:  6 logins this month — uses it to track deliverables for clients
Day 45:  Considers switching back to Trello (more familiar)
Day 60:  Still deciding — "I like it but don't use it enough to justify $29"
```

### Behavior Patterns
| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Login Frequency | 2-3x/week (6-12 logins/month) | Casual usage |
| Features Used | 3 out of 7 | Under-utilizing product |

### Empathy Map: Rohan

#### What He SAYS
- "It's nice, but honestly I only use it for task lists and file storage."
- "The Workflow Builder thing looks complicated — I don't need it."
- "Trello was simpler but this looks more professional for clients."
- "$29/month feels pricey for what I use (maybe 2 features)."
- "I keep forgetting to check it — I live in my email and Figma."

#### What He THINKS (But Doesn't Say)
- *"I feel stupid for not understanding the automation stuff."*
- *"Am I using this wrong? Everyone else seems to love it."*
- *"Maybe I should just go back to spreadsheets — this is overkill for me."*
- *"The onboarding felt overwhelming — I just wanted to start working."*
- *"I haven't invited any clients because I'm not sure they'd use it either."*

#### What He DOES
- Logs in 2-3x/week, usually when starting a new client project
- Uses only: Task Boards (Kanban), File Hub, Time Tracking
- Has never opened Workflow Builder, Team Huddles, Analytics, or Client Portal
- Spends <5 minutes per session — checks tasks, uploads file, leaves
- Keeps a mental note to "explore more features" but never does
- Has considered canceling 3 times but renews "to give it another month"

#### What He FEELS
| Moment | Emotion | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **First signup** | Excited | "This looks professional for my freelance business" |
| **Onboarding Step 4** | Overwhelmed | "Wait, I have to learn workflows? I just want to organize tasks" |
| **Day 30 bill** | Annoyed | "$29 for 2 features? Trello was free" |
| **Client asks for update** | Uncertain | "I hope I didn't miss anything in TeamFlow" |
| **Considering churn** | Guilty | "I should use it more since I'm paying for it" |

#### Pain Points
1. **Onboarding felt too long** — 8 steps felt like homework before getting value
2. **Workflow Builder complexity** — Looks technical, he's a designer not a workflow engineer
3. **Solo user — no collaboration** — Collaboration features are irrelevant to him
4. **Price vs. usage** — $29/mo for 3 features feels expensive vs. competitors
5. **No re-engagement** — Company never reached out when usage dropped

#### Gains (What He Values)
1. **Visual task management** — Kanban boards match how he thinks
2. **File Hub** — All client files in one place (vs. scattered in Google Drive)
3. **Professional appearance** — Can share boards with clients without giving them full access
4. **Time Tracking** — Easy billing proof for hourly clients
5. **Clean UI** — "Looks better than Trello" (aesthetic matters to designers)

### Churn Risk Assessment

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Login Frequency** | 0/25 | 6-12 logins/month — not below threshold |
| **Onboarding** | 20/20 | Stuck at Step 3 — AT RISK |
| **Feature Breadth** | 20/20 | Only 3 features — AT RISK |
| **Collaboration** | 20/20 | Never used — AT RISK |
| **Inactivity** | 0/15 | Last login 3 days ago |
| **TOTAL RISK SCORE** | **60/100** | **AMBER — At-Risk** |

### Retention Strategy for Rohan
- **DO**: Send "Feature Discovery" nudge (Nudge Type B) highlighting Time Tracking value
- **DO**: Offer "Freelancer Success Guide" — 5-min video on how other designers use it
- **DO**: Down-sell to annual plan ($240/yr = $20/mo) — feels cheaper
- **DO**: Celebrate small wins: "You've saved 12 hours this month using Time Tracking"
- **DON'T**: Send complex automation tutorials (he doesn't care)
- **DON'T**: Push collaboration features (he's a solo user)

### Intervention Recommendation
**Trigger**: User at Step 3 for 14+ days, using only 2-3 features

**Nudge Copy**:
> "Hey Rohan — most freelancers who use Time Tracking save 2 hours/week on billing. Want a 2-minute video on how to automate your invoices with just 1 more click?"

**Expected Outcome**: 30% of casual users like Rohan upgrade engagement to 4-5 features within 7 days

## Persona 3: Priya — The Churned User

### Profile Summary

| **Name** | Priya Menon |
| **Age** | 34 |
| **Role** | Operations Manager at a 45-person SME manufacturing company |
| **Team Size** | Manages 12 people across 3 departments |
| **Tech Savviness** | Low-Medium — comfortable with email, basic tools |

| **Status** | **CHURNED** — Cancelled on Day 62 |

### User Journey
```
Day 0:   Signs up after CEO said "we need a project management tool"
Day 1:   Creates account, feels optimistic about organizing team work
Day 2:   Logs in, sees 8-step onboarding checklist
Day 3:   Completes Steps 1-3 (create project, invite team, create tasks)

|--------|-------|----------------|
| Login Frequency | Day 14 → 0 logins | Complete disengagement |
| Features Used | 3 out of 7 | Never reached value |

### Empathy Map: Priya

#### What She SAID (in exit survey)
- "It was too complex for my team — they're not tech-savvy."
- "The onboarding felt like homework — I just wanted to start working."
- "I tried to get my team to use it but nobody wanted to learn a new tool."
- "Excel was working fine for us — this felt like overkill."
- "Nobody from your company reached out when we stopped using it."

#### What She THOUGHT (But Didn't Say)
- *"I feel like I failed — CEO asked me to organize the team and I couldn't."*
- *"Maybe my team is the problem? Everyone else seems to use this successfully."*
- *"I spent $79 and got zero value — that's embarrassing."*
- *"I wish there was a human who could have helped us get started."*
- *"If someone had called at Day 14, we might have stuck with it."*

#### What She DID
- Day 0-14: Enthusiastic, invited 12 team members
- Day 7: Tried to demonstrate Team Huddles in team meeting — got blank stares
- Day 10: Attempted Workflow Builder, couldn't figure it out, felt frustrated
- Day 14: Stopped logging in entirely
- Day 21-45: Complete silence — 0 logins from anyone on team
- Day 58: Quick login to export data, cancels same day
- Day 62: Sends cancellation email with one-line feedback

#### What She FELT
| Moment | Emotion | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Signup** | Hopeful | "Finally, we'll get organized" |
| **Day 7 team meeting** | Humiliated | "My team rejected my tool choice" |
| **Day 10 confusion** | Inadequate | "I don't understand this — am I dumb?" |
| **Day 30 bill** | Resentful | "$79 for something we don't use" |
| **Cancellation** | Relieved | "At least I don't have to think about it anymore" |

#### Pain Points
1. **Onboarding too long** — 8 steps before value = "homework not help"
2. **Team adoption friction** — Non-tech team rejected it, no support provided
3. **Workflow Builder complexity** — Couldn't figure it out, no tutorial
4. **No human touch** — Company never reached out when usage dropped at Day 14
5. **Excel was "good enough"** — Switching costs weren't justified by early value

#### Gains (What She Would Have Valued)
1. **Guided onboarding** — A human to walk them through first project setup
2. **Simpler first steps** — Value in Step 1-2, not Step 7
3. **Team training materials** — Videos or docs for non-tech teams
4. **Proactive check-in** — A Day 14 email asking "how's it going?"
5. **Simpler workflow builder** — Or at least better tutorials

### Churn Risk Assessment (Pre-Churn)

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Login Frequency** | 25/25 | 0 logins since Day 14 |
| **Onboarding** | 20/20 | Stuck at Step 4 |
| **Feature Breadth** | 20/20 | Only 3 features used |
| **Collaboration** | 20/20 | Team rejected it |
| **Inactivity** | 15/15 | 14+ days inactive |
| **TOTAL RISK SCORE** | **100/100** | **RED — High Risk (Churned)** |

### What Would Have Saved Priya?
**The Day 14 Intervention That Never Happened**

If TeamFlow had sent this nudge at Day 14:

> "Hi Priya — noticed your team hasn't logged in for a week. Want to schedule a free 15-min setup call? We'll help you get your first project running. Most teams who do this call save 5 hours/week."

**Expected Outcome**: 40% of users like Priya would have accepted the call → 70% of those would have stayed

**Cost**: 15 minutes of Customer Success time ≈ $10
**Revenue Saved**: $79 × 12 months = $948 LTV
**ROI**: 9,380%

### The Silent Exit Pattern (Priya's Timeline)
```
Week 1-2:  Active but confused
Week 3:    SILENCE (the danger zone — no one noticed)
Week 4-6:  More silence
Week 8:    Bill arrives → resentment builds
Week 9:   Final login (data export)
Week 9:   Churn
```

**Key Insight**: Priya didn't churn because the product was bad. She churned because **no one noticed she was struggling**.

## Cross-Persona Analysis: BA Insights

### The 4.6x Insight Explained

| Persona | Onboarding Step Reached | Churn Outcome | Why? |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|------|
| **Maya** | Step 8 (completed) | Retained | Reached aha moment — saw value |
| **Rohan** | Step 3 (stuck) | At-risk | Never saw workflow automation value |
| **Priya** | Step 4 (stuck) | Churned | Team didn't adopt, no rescue attempt |

**The Pattern**: Every step beyond Step 4 dramatically reduces churn risk.

| Step | Users Here | Churn Rate | Retention vs. Step 1-3 |
|------|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| 1-3  | 45% of users | 52% | Baseline (high churn) |
| 4-6  | 35% of users | 28% | 1.9x better retention |
| 7-8  | 20% of users | 8% | **6.5x better retention** |

### The Collaboration Effect

| Persona | Used Collaboration? | Churn Outcome |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|
| Maya | Yes (heavy) | Retained |
| Rohan | No (solo) | At-risk |
| Priya | No (team rejected) | Churned |

**Insight**: Collaboration isn't just a feature — it's a **retention mechanism**. Users who invite teammates create network effects that make churn 3.6x less likely.

### The Silent Exit Warning Signs

| Warning Sign | Appears At | Priya Showed It? | Rescue Window |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Login drop | Day 7-14 | ✅ Day 14 | Day 14-21 (critical) |
| Onboarding stall | Day 10+ | ✅ Day 10 | Day 10-14 |
| Zero collaboration | Day 14+ | ✅ Day 7 | Day 7-14 |
| Support silence | Day 14+ | ✅ Never | Day 14-21 |

**The 14-Day Rule**: If a user shows any warning sign between Day 7-14, that's your **rescue window**. After Day 21, it's usually too late.

## Business Implications

### Revenue Impact by Persona

| Persona | Monthly Revenue | Annual Projection | Churn Risk |
|---------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Maya (Power)** | $199 × 30 users = $5,970 | $71,640 | 5% → LTV $6,839/user |
| **Rohan (Casual)** | $29 × 120 users = $3,480 | $41,760 | 35% → LTV $693/user |
| **Priya (Churned)** | $79 × 75 users = $5,925 | $0 | 100% → LTV $79 |

### The Opportunity

If we convert **30% of Casual users (Rohan) to Power users (Maya)** through targeted interventions:

- Current: 120 casual users × $29 = $3,480 MRR
- After conversion: 36 users × $79 = $2,846 MRR
- Net impact: Still 84 casual users × $29 = $2,436 MRR
- **Total: $5,282 MRR** vs. $3,480 MRR = **+$1,802 MRR (+52%)**

### The Cost of Inaction

If we do nothing:
- 75 users × $79 = $5,925 MRR will churn this year
- 42 casual users (35%) × $29 = $1,218 MRR will churn this year
- **Total annual lost revenue: $85,716**
