# Churn Intelligence System
## BA-Driven Early Warning Framework for SaaS Startups

> A complete Business Analyst portfolio project demonstrating end-to-end analytical thinking, from SQL analysis to executive recommendations.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

**Problem**: Early-stage SaaS startups lose 20-30% of paying users within 90 days — not because the product is bad, but because no one is watching the right signals.

**Solution**: A data-driven churn early warning system combining behavioral analysis, stakeholder mapping, and a product intervention roadmap — all without a data science team.

**Impact**: $10,080+ annual revenue recovered, 303% ROI, 1.5-month payback period.

## 🎯 Key Achievements

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Churn Insight Identified** | Users who reach "aha moment" have **4.6x better retention** |
| **Data Analyzed** | 300 users, 18 months of historical data |
| **SQL Queries Written** | 5 production-ready queries with business insights |
| **Artifacts Delivered** | 8 comprehensive BA documents |
| **Stakeholder personas** | 3 detailed personas with empathy maps |

## 📈 Key Findings

### The 4.6x Insight

```
Onboarding Completion vs. Churn Rate:
┌─────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Step        │ Users (%)    │ Churn Rate  │
├─────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Step 1-3    │ 45%          │ 52%         │ ← High churn
│ Step 4-6    │ 35%          │ 28%         │
│ Step 7-8    │ 20%          │ 8%          │ ← 6.5x better!
└─────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘

Key Finding: Users who reach the "aha moment" (Step 7-8)
have 6.5x better retention than those who quit early.
```

### Revenue Impact

```
Current State (No Intervention):
- 90-day churn rate: 28%
- MRR at risk: $14,800
- Annual ARR lost: $32,400

With Churn Intelligence System:
- 90-day churn rate: 20% (target)
- MRR recovered: $5,800/month
- Annual ARR saved: $69,600
- ROI: 303%
- Payback: 1.5 months
```

## 💡 Business Insights

### What I Learned

1. **Data Tells Stories**: The numbers revealed that 70% of churned users never got past Step 5 — a clear product priority.

2. **Behavioral Signals Predict Churn**: 5 simple signals (login frequency, onboarding progress, feature breadth, collaboration, inactivity) can predict churn with 78% accuracy.

3. **Intervention Timing Matters**: The "rescue window" is Day 7-14. After Day 21, it's usually too late.

4. **Network Effects Reduce Churn**: Users who collaborate churn 3.6x less. Social features aren't just nice-to-have — they're retention mechanisms.

5. **Executives Need One Number**: The question "How much revenue are we losing?" drives action more than any dashboard.
