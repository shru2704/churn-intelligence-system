3. **Click**: "Sign up" button (top-right corner)
4. **Fill in the form**:
   - Email address (use a professional email)
   - Password (make it strong and memorable)
   - Username (this will be public, like `shruti-analyst` or similar)

   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have files)
4. **Click**: "Create repository"

**✓ Done!** GitHub will show you a page with some commands — **ignore them for now**.

2. A dialog appears — fill in:

   - **Description**: `Churn Intelligence System - Business Analyst Portfolio Project`
   - **Privacy**: Make sure **"Public"** is selected (for portfolio)
3. **Click**: "Publish repository"

**✓ Done!** Your files are now on GitHub!
